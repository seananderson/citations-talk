# Citations and Citation Managers

## When to cite

Opinions vary widely on this and it's partly an art.

Cite a paper when first introducing a concept. If you keep talking about a concept then you probably won't cite the same paper every time. If you keep talking about a referenced topic in a paragraph, one approach is to cite at beginning and end.

Be weary of over-citing. Don't use your citations like crutches.

You should be weaving a narrative around your citations, not leaving a literature dump for your reader. Interpret your citations, critically evaluate your citations, and show how they fit into your story.

Use citations to acknowledge other's work, aid the reader to investigate more, and convince the reader you know what you're talking about. But in the end, remember the paper is about your science, your writing, and your thoughts. So don't cite to show off and don't cite to hide.

## Who to cite

Don't be afraid to cite fundamental (i.e. old) papers.

Citing a fundamental paper plus a more recent paper is a common approach.

Remember you can't cite everything. Rarely will you be completely comprehensive on a topic.

Cite a paper for its main finding, not (usually) the other things in it (e.g. the introduction). A common exception to this is citing a paper for an idea proposed in the discussion section.

This is a good time to think about what that *one thing* is that someone else is going to cite your paper for. Make sure to hit the reader over the head with that one thing multiple times.

If you cite it you should read it. At least skim it and have a good grasp of the paper yourself. Don't rely on someone else's interpretation. This is a great opportunity to handle some old books in the library.

## Keeping up with stuff

Use [RSS feeds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0klgLsSxGsU) to keep up with papers. If you don't have an RSS reader already, try [Feedly](http://feedly.com/).

If your feed reader has them, use smart folders to highlight topics you're interested in. E.g. Filter for all papers that have the words "diversity" in the title or abstract or filter for all papers by a set of authors you're interested in.

Don't drown in all the papers. Don't feel guilty skimming and marking all as read. Most important papers you'll stumble on again later.

If you really don't want to use RSS, then sign up for email table-of-contents alerts.

Read narrowly and broadly. Read intensely on your specific topic. But, also occasionally read outside your topic. This is important for your development as a scientist. It gives you the tools and awareness to ask interesting questions and solve problems creatively. 

One way to read broadly, is to follow some overview-style journals like Trends in Ecology and Evolution and Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment. Many ecology journals now have review articles too.

If you really want to read broadly, try sitting down at the library occasionally and flipping through the latest journal issues. You're much more likely to stumble on something outside your current interests this way.

Use citation alerts. The Google Scholar ones are good. You set up search terms and get an email whenever new papers come out with those terms. Or, pick three or four key papers on your topic, and get notified whenever someone new cites those papers. This will capture new papers in journals you don't follow in your RSS feeds (or in your email table-of-contents alerts).

## Getting stuff off campus

Ezproxy! Ezproxy! Use an Ezproxy bookmarklet. This is a bookmark in your browser with some Javascript in front of it to reload the current page through the university's proxy server. This lets you access anything the library has access to from off campus.

To create one, make a bookmark to anything at all. Call it something like `ezproxy`. Then edit the URL to your university's proxy server. For Simon Fraser University:

    javascript:u=window.location.href;window.location.href='http://'+u.substring(7,u.indexOf('/',8))+'.proxy.lib.sfu.ca/'+u.substr(u.indexOf('/',8)+1);

Now, when you're on a journal page you want to get access to, click the bookmark and enter your password. You'll only have to enter your password occasionally.

## Citation managers

Use one! You're nuts in this day and age to spend your time copying, pasting, re-formatting, and checking citations.

Know your citation manager well and curate it. Think of it as your digital brain. As a researcher, this is one of your most important tools.

###	Which one?

Common and good citation managers are Zotero, Mendeley, Papers, and Bibdesk. There's also Endnote if you absolutely have to, or if you're already familiar with it.

Do I need MS Word compatibility? If yes, that rules out Bibdesk.

Do I mind fiddly recompiling when I edit citations? If yes, that rules out Papers.

Do I mind Elsevier? If yes, that rules out Mendeley.

Do I want an integrated PDF viewer? If yes, that rules out Zotero.

Do I want an open source citation manager? If yes, that rules out Papers and Endnote.

Otherwise, if you don't already have a favourite citation manager, then try a few and pick which one you like best. Don't forget to try everything you'll be doing with it. That includes making a little test document and editing the citations.

### Using your citation manager effectively

Try and weed out garbage as you go (incorrect meta-data) or you're in for a world of hurt later.

On the other hand, you don't have to save everything you read. I save a PDF in my citation manager if I think I might cite it someday (or if I think it's really cool and I might want to re-read it or share it someday).

Throw papers into broad folders for papers you're writing or potential future papers.

Rely on search in your citation manager as much as possible. Is it in the title? Great, no need to tag it. Is it not in the title but something you might want to search? Tag it, or throw words into a notes field.

Consider a tag/folder strategy. Tags can work well for broad topics (e.g. diversity-stability); folders for short-term projects (thesis chapter 1). Keep in mind that most reference manager folders aren't really folders. I.e. you can have the same paper in multiple folders.

Smart folders: use them. Smart folders are a custom search you set up. The folder then stays up to date as the papers change.
