# Citation managers

Use one! You're nuts in this day and age to spend your time copying, pasting, re-formatting, and checking citations.

Know your citation manager well and curate it. Think of it as your digital brain. As a researcher, this is one of your most important tools.


##	Which one?

Common and good citation managers are Zotero, Mendeley, Papers, and Bibdesk. There's also Endnote if you absolutely have to, or if you're already familiar with it.

Do I need MS Word compatibility? If yes, that rules out Bibdesk.

Do I mind fiddly recompiling when I edit citations? If yes, that rules out Papers.

Do I mind Elsevier? If yes, that rules out Mendeley.

Do I want an integrated PDF viewer? If yes, that rules out Zotero.

Do I want an open source citation manager? If yes, that rules out Papers and Endnote.

Otherwise, if you don't already have a favourite citation manager, then try a few and pick which one you like best. Don't forget to try everything you'll be doing with it. That includes making a little test document and editing the citations.

# Who to cite

Opinions vary widely on this and it's partly an art.

Don't be afraid to cite fundamental papers.

Citing a fundamental paper plus a more recent paper is a common approach.

Remember you can't cite everything. Rarely are you completely comprehensive on a topic.

Cite a paper for their main finding, not (usually) the other things they talk about (e.g. the introduction).

This is a good time to think about what the one thing someone else is going to cite your paper for? Make that point clear.

# When to cite

Cite a paper when first introducing a concept. If you keep talking about a concept then you probably won't cite the same paper every time. If you keep talking about a referenced topic in a paragraph, one approach is to cite at beginning and end.

Be weary of over-citing. Don't use your citations like crutches.

You should be weaving a narrative around your citations, not leaving a literature dump for your reader. Interpret your citations, critically evaluate your citations, and show how they fit into your story.

Use citations to acknowledge other's work, aid the reader to investigate more, and convince the reader you know what you're talking about. But in the end, remember the paper is about your science, your writing, and your thoughts. So don't cite to show off and don't cite to hide.

# Using citation managers

Try and weed out garbage as you go (incorrect meta-data) or you're in for a world of hurt later.

On the other hand, you don't have to save everything you read. I save a PDF in my citation manager if I think I might cite it someday (or if I think it's really cool and I might want to re-read it or share it someday).

Throw papers into broad folders for papers you're writing or potential future papers.

Rely on search in your citation manager as much as possible. Is it in the title? Great, no need to tag it. Is it not in the title but something you might want to search? Tag it, or throw words into a notes field.

Consider a tag/folder strategy. Tags can work well for broad topics (e.g. diversity-stability); folders for short-term projects (thesis chapter 1). Keep in mind that most reference manager folders aren't really folders. I.e. you can have the same folder in many folders.

Smart folders: use them. Smart folders are a custom search you set up. The folder then stays up to date as the papers change.

# Keeping up with stuff

RSS feeds. If you don't have one already, try Feedly.

If available, use smart folders in RSS readers to highlight topics you're interested in.

Don't drown in all the papers. Don't feel guilty skimming and marking all as read. Most important papers you'll stumble on again later.

Read narrowly and broadly. Read intensely on your specific topic. But, also occasionally read outside your topic. This is important for your development as a scientist. It gives you the tools and awareness to ask interesting questions and solve problems creatively. 

One way to read broadly, is to follow some overview-style journals like Trends in Ecology and Evolution and Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment. Many ecology journals now have review articles too.

Use citation alerts. The Google Scholar ones are good. You set up search terms and get an email whenever new papers come out with those terms. Or, pick three or four key papers on your topic, and get notified whenever someone new cites those papers.

# Getting stuff off campus

Ezproxy! Ezproxy! Use an Ezproxy bookmarklet. This is a bookmark in your browser with some Javascript in front of it to reload the current page through the university's proxy server. This lets you access anything the library has access to from off campus.

To create one, make a bookmark to anything at all. Call it something like `ezproxy`. Then edit the URL to your university's proxy server. For Simon Fraser University:

    javascript:u=window.location.href;window.location.href='http://'+u.substring(7,u.indexOf('/',8))+'.proxy.lib.sfu.ca/'+u.substr(u.indexOf('/',8)+1);

Now, when you're on a journal page you want to get access to, click the bookmark and enter your password. You'll only have to enter your password occasionally.
